    description: >
      For "big data" applications, we often have thousands or millions of p-values.
      The QQ-plot is a standard way to evaluate them, but can be horrifyingly slow when there are many p-values.
      This package computes where all the points would go in the naive implementation, then thins them strategically to greatly reduce overplotting, resulting in much faster plotting.

      A Natural Language Interface to 'ggplot2'.
    description: >
      The 'ggplot2' package is the state-of-the-art toolbox for 
      creating and formatting graphs. However, it is easy to forget 
      how certain formatting commands are named and sometimes users 
      find themselves asking: How do you rotate the x-axis labels again? 
      Or how do you hide the legend...? This package allows users to issue 
      natural language commands related to theme-related styling of plots 
      (colors, font size and such), which then are translated into valid 
      'ggplot2' commands.

In addition to reducing overplotting, it helps visualize the density of the data at each point (similar to a violin plot), while still showing each data point. `ggbeeswarm `provides two different methods to create beeswarm-style plots using ggplot2. `geom_quasirandom()` uses a van der Corput sequence or Tukey texturing  o space the dots to avoid overplotting. `geom_beeswarm()` uses the Aron Ecklund's `beeswarm` library to do point-size based offset.

    description: >
      There are several ways to visualize data points on a 2D coordinate system: If you have lots of data
      points on top of each other, `geom_point()` fails to give you an estimate of how many points are overlapping.
      `geom_density2d()` and `geom_bin2d()` solve this issue, but they make it impossible to investigate individual
      outlier points, which may be of interest. `geom_pointdensity()` aims to solve this problem by combining the
      best of both worlds: individual points are colored by the number of neighboring points. This allows you to
      see the overall distribution, as well as individual points.

      1. More flexible label settings;

         which is helpful for operations such as puzzles; 
      3. Simple and easy to operate; 
      4. Optimization of clustering tree visualization.

      An implementation of ‘Ichimoku Kinko Hyo’, also commonly known as ‘cloud charts’.
      As described in Sasaki (1996, ISBN:4925152009), the technique is a refinement
      on candlestick charting, originating from Japan and now in widespread use in
      technical analysis worldwide. Translating as ‘one-glance equilibrium chart’, it
      allows the price action and market structure of financial securities to be
      determined ‘at-a-glance’.

      Extended ComplexHeatmap with ggplot2
    description: >
      This package serves as a bridge between the ggplot2 and ComplexHeatmap packages. 
      Essentially, all ggplot2 geometries and operations can be utilized in ComplexHeatmap through the eheat package, 
      with the exception of facet operations (and you shouldn’t do it in eheat package). Fortunately, ComplexHeatmap
      is capable of handling these operations independently, rendering them unnecessary.

      Forest plots of model coefficients, Likert plots and custom proportions
    description: >
      This package provides new statistics, new geometries and new positions for 'ggplot2' 
      and a suite of functions to facilitate the creation of statistical plots such as
      forest plots of model coefficients, bar plots for Likert-type items, custom
      proportions or survey data.
